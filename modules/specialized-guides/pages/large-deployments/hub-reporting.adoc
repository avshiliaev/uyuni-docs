[[lsd-hub-reporting]]
= Hub Reporting
The Hub prepares and provides content for multiple peripheral {productname} Servers. The goal is now to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub.
The data are made available for external Reporting Tools.

== Architecture
The main database is a PostgresDB in the {productname} Hub system.  It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and eventually aggregates them. 
Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary:

- the DB in {productname} Hub stores, collects and eventually aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers,
- the DB in {productname} Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub,
- the DB in peripheral {productname} Server stores its own data,
- the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any {productname} Server.

== Setup
Database and schema are setup by default.

=== Create a DB user for the reporting

Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created.
For doing that, it is possible to use ``uyuni-setup-reportdb-user`` .

== Database Schema

The schema export the most important tables from the main {productname} Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report.

A ready-to-use reports are provided with views doing joins over multiple tables.

Every table gets an extra column for the {productname} server id of server which provide the data `mgm_id`. 
On a single {productname} Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent "localhost". 
On the {productname} Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database.

The `synced_date` represent the time when the data were exported from the main {productname} Server database.
